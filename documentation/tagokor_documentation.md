## TAGOKOR Documentation

Documentation related to the archival series "Korean War Casualty File (TAGOKOR), 2/13/1950 - 12/31/1953, Records on Korean War Dead and Wounded Army Casualties, 1950-1970," in Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1905-1981, Record Group 407, at National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) held by the Center for Electronic Records at "A2" in College Park, MD.

  * Technical Documentation: Technical documentation created by NARA describing TAGOKOR is available from NARA online at http://research.archives.gov/description/1128348.
  
  * Paper Documentation: Though TAGOKOR is an electronic record, the collection does include one archival box of additional paper documentation. Most (though not all) of these documents were photographed on a research visit to the Center for Electronic Records at "A2" (NARA, College Park, MD) in Summer 2013. A PDF of that documentation can be found at http://jeffersonbailey.com/tagokor\_data/tagokor\_paper\_documentation.pdf. 
  
  * Accession Dossier: An accession dossier is NARA's administrative file for an archival collection. As an active record, accession dossiers are not publicly available to researchers, but can be obtained via FOIA request (which NARA often encourages for those interested). The documentation included here are scans of the entirety of the set of documents sent to me in response to my FOIA request, a copy of which is also included. A PDF of that documentation can be found at http://jeffersonbailey.com/tagokor\_data/tagokor\_accession_dossier.pdf.
